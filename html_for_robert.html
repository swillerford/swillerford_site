	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a 20 year old International Politics and Economics major at Middlebury College with a commitment to success and dedication to fun. I grew up in Bainbridge Island, Washington.  I've traveled around the world (though there will always have more to see) but I always try to take advantage of the people and the landscape at home whenever I can.  When I'm not working I can usually be found tramping around the Vermont woods or scaling rock faces; if it's snowy I might be skiing off of them instead.</p>
