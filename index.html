			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="/img/profile_photo_6-2014.jpg" id="profile_photo">
			<p>I'm a 22 year old entrepreneur and operations guru with a commitment to success and boundless curiosity. I grew up in Bainbridge Island, Washington, and currently live and work in Washington, DC. I've traveled around the world (though there will always have more to see) but I always try to take advantage of the people and the landscape at home whenever I can. When I'm not working I can usually be found tramping around the woods or scaling rock faces; if it's snowy I might be skiing off of them instead.</p>
			<p>In the past few years I've helped build a startup's operations process from the ground up, led outdoor trips for new Middlebury students, worked for the Department of Homeland Security to identify war criminals, and studied economics in Argentina, among other things.  My varied experiences around the world have driven me to look for innovative, holistic solutions to problems, whether they be an automated energy efficiency project finance process or my latest backyard engineering project. I realize that the most promising resource available to any problem-solver is human capital, and I aim to utilize it to its fullest extent both as a leader and a teammate.</p>
